# Objectives
1. To understand existing code for performing context-switches in the xv6 kernel
2. To implement a basic multi-level round-robin scheduler where priorities are statically assigned
3. To implement a system call that extracts process states
4. To implement a user-level process that controls the scheduling of children processes
# Overview
In this project, youâ€™ll be implementing a multi-level queue scheduler in xv6. This multi-level queue scheduler is easier to implement than the multi-level feedback queue (MLFQ) we discussed in lecture because your scheduler is missing the word "feedback";  that is, the priorities in your scheduler are changed not based on the dynamic behavior of processes, but are based on explicit system calls to modify the priority of each process.

The basic idea is simple. Build an MLQ scheduler with four priority queues; the top queue (numbered 3) has the highest priority and the bottom queue (numbered 0) has the lowest priority. When a process uses up its time-slice (counted as a number of ticks), it stays at its priority level, but is moved to the back of that queue.  The scheduling method in each of these queues is thus Round Robin (RR). The time-slices for higher priorities will be shorter than lower priorities.
