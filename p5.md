# Objectives
1. To learn about the virtual memory system in xv6
2. To modify how physical memory can be allocated (compared to a simple linked list) 

# Main Idea
As you know, the abstraction of an address space per process is a great way to provide isolation (i.e., protection) across processes.  However, even with this abstraction,  attackers can still try to modify or access portions of memory that they do not have permission for.  For example, in a Rowhammer attack, a malicious process can repeatedly write to certain addresses in order to cause bit flips in DRAM in nearby (physical) addresses that the process does not have permission to write directly.    In this project, we are using security attacks as a motivation for our changes in xv6, but our purpose is really to understand how to change the xv6 memory system in controlled ways.

In this project, you'll implement one (not very sophisticated) way to alleviate the impact of a malicious process: allocating pages from different processes so that they are not physically adjacent

You will also implement a routine to allow a user to gather statistics about your memory system and test your implementation.
